If you like the saucy burgers then you can ask for extra sauce and if you like the plain ones (my choice) you can ask for less or no sauce. When you take less sauce you can get the true burger flavor and it's actually quite good. Their fish tots, in particular, are a standout. For the price, they are incredible. Their chicken fingers are filled with cheese, and their wings I've heard are nice. They even have a dessert menu now which is actually very decent. They have increased their prices substantially. They are no longer the cheap good burger place, a filling meal would cost around 500 taka per person. One other issue I personally have can be the crowd. Chillox is a bit of a staple for young kids and although they can normally be calm, sometimes it can get quite loud, especially near their smoking zone. If you're looking to go here at a good time with fewer people then definitely go during lunchtime."

You can never go wrong about their food quality. Regarded quantity to a whole new level in terms of price, to be honest. Service is basically not the hype but what else would you need as long as your tummy gets satisfied? Always go for set menus that include fried rice because that’s fulfilling and relishing according to my buds. Please spare some extra time during evenings when it gets very busy + noisy. Hence takeaways are recommended while it’s too crowded and you’re possibly struggling to get a seat."

With time I feel as though their pasta has lost a bit of its previous flavor, but it's still decent most days. Their cream of mushroom soup is the best one I've had in Dhanmondi so far. I've heard very good things about their biryani too. The location is incredible. From the very large balcony, there is a stunning view of Dhanmondi lake. However, I feel as though their interior could be way better. Their interior is straight up bad. Not even decent, it's actually bad. If you go, definitely sit on the balcony for the best experience. The staff has always been very friendly and accommodating. Only one bad experience with a new waiter in the past 7 years."
